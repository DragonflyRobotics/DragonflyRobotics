# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile repository. Let me tell you some facts about me

## About Me
I am a robotics hobbyist. I first started off with Arduino. This was roughly 6.5 years ago. Wow! This escalated one sensor after another. It is incredible how much you can learn and make using an tiny microcontroller. I made several wheeled robots, cars, and even a super car. That was basically a car with obstacle avoidance strapped to a Google Assistant. I know, brilliant :). 
Then, I got a Raspberry Pi which introduced me to the Python. First Python, then object detection, then AI. Now, when I "made" my first AI, it was example code that I changed the variables and a few things here and there. But, that itself taught me a lot. 

Besides that, I also enjoy Calculus. Those differential equations and integrations are incredibly enjoyable. The REALLY HARD math puzzles are just as fun!. I also love quantum mechanics and special relativity. Yep, all the hard stuff.

## My Projects
### DeepShift Labs
This is my biggest project yet. This is a research institution I started. We aim to use biomimetic robotics to develop a general intelligence. Yes, an AI that learns like a living being! We are using multi-agent AI algorithms, real-time database, and semi-supervised AI algorithms. We are also making a fully 3D printed 12DOF robot dog. That will be the first host of our AI.

### Custom YOLO Algorithm
What happens when you combine image area search, temperature predictions, and a simple CNN. You get an AI that trains and functions on any machine (even the ones from 10 years ago) and predicts in ~0.5 seconds. It highlights different regions of an image that contain a given object. Then, it draws a bounding box around it. It is super simple, but quite efficient. 

## Contributing
I am always looking for people to work with, and DeepShift Labs is also looking for contributers. If you are interested, please don't hesitate to email me at [deepshiftlabs@outlook.com](deepshiftlabs@outlook.com). You can also just contact me through Github.
* Here is my [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/project-zeta) if you want to contribute monetary value to my projects.

I am also very passionate about contributing. I am trying to solve issues on ROS, Arduino, and other smaller Github Repositories. I think that it is crucial to giveback to the community that our hobby came from. The OpenSource movement has resulted in incredible feats and the reapid expansion of software and hardware capabilities. I am only now understanding the difficulty of being an OpenSource developer. That is why I contribute to other projects.
